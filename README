This is a fork of Yacoby's fork of Wrye Mash, in an attempt to port it to more operating systems and make use openmw's new features such as seperate data directories.

TODO:
- Make all functions that use or look for a morrowind directory use a user chosen mod directory instead
- Change all functions that use morrowind.ini to handle openmw.cfg instead (this is where the bulk of the work is going to be)
- Disable troublesome features such as save manager, and ini tweaks untill i can get all the basic stuff running
- Rewrite MWIiniFile class as OMWCfgFile to support openmw.cfg
